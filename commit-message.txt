Add production deployment scripts and configuration

This commit adds production deployment support for both Windows and Ubuntu environments:

- Added start:all script to run both client and server in production
- Created ecosystem.config.js for PM2 process management
- Added deployment scripts for Windows (deploy.bat) and Ubuntu (deploy-ubuntu.sh)
- Updated .gitignore to exclude server/.env file
- Enhanced package.json with production start scripts

These changes make it easier to deploy and manage the application in production environments while maintaining the secure server-side approach for API keys and sensitive operations.
