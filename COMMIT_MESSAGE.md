Implement secure server-side API approach

## Summary
This commit implements a comprehensive security improvement by moving API keys and sensitive operations to a secure server-side approach. This is a significant architectural change that addresses critical security vulnerabilities in the previous implementation.

## Key Changes

### Server Implementation
- Added Express server to handle API requests securely
- Implemented secure proxy endpoints for third-party APIs (MapTiler)
- Created authentication middleware using Firebase Admin SDK
- Added secure Firestore operations with proper access control
- Implemented proper error handling and response formatting

### Client-Side Security
- Removed API keys from client-side code
- Updated components to use secure API services
- Implemented proper loading and error states
- Minimized Firebase configuration to only what's needed for authentication
- Created secure hooks for authentication and data access

### Documentation
- Added API_KEY_SECURITY.md explaining the secure approach
- Updated SECURE_API_APPROACH.md with implementation details
- Enhanced README.md with security considerations
- Created SECURITY_UPDATES.md summarizing all changes

## Security Benefits
- API keys are no longer exposed in client-side code or network requests
- All sensitive operations are authenticated and authorized
- Reduced attack surface by centralizing data access
- Improved error handling and user experience
- Better separation of concerns between frontend and backend

## Testing
- Tested authentication flow with secure approach
- Verified MapTiler integration works through secure proxy
- Confirmed Firestore operations work through secure API
- Validated error handling for various scenarios

## Next Steps
- Continue testing all functionality thoroughly
- Deploy both client and server components
- Monitor for any security issues or performance concerns
- Keep documentation updated as the application evolves

This commit represents a significant improvement in the security posture of the application and follows industry best practices for handling API keys and sensitive operations.
