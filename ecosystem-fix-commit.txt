Fix PM2 ecosystem config for ES modules

This commit addresses the PM2 configuration issue with ES modules:

- Created ecosystem.config.cjs with CommonJS format
- Updated deployment scripts to use the .cjs file
- Fixed compatibility with projects using "type": "module"

This change ensures the PM2 configuration works correctly on both development and production environments, regardless of the module system used in the project.
