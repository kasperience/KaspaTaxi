Add file copy step to deployment script

This commit adds an important step to the Ubuntu deployment script:

- Added command to copy built files to the web server directory
- Uses sudo to ensure proper permissions
- Copies from dist/ to /var/www/html3/

This ensures the built client files are properly deployed to the web server's
public directory, making them accessible through the configured web server.
