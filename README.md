**Welcome to KaspaTaxi!**

KaspaTaxi is an open-source project demonstrating a decentralized, transparent, and community-driven approach to ride-booking. Our vision is to empower independent taxi drivers and provide riders with a secure and direct way to connect and transact using the speed and efficiency of the Kaspa blockchain, ultimately aiming to reduce costs by eliminating intermediaries.

## ðŸš• Try the Demo (MVP)

Experience the current KaspaTaxi MVP in action: [kaspataxi.KASperience.xyz](https://kaspataxi.KASperience.xyz)

*Note: The MVP focuses on demonstrating the core user interface, ride flow, and direct Kaspa payment initiation. Deeper blockchain integration and backend automation are planned for future phases.*

## Why Kaspa? (Our Vision)

*   **Decentralization & Transparency:** We aim to build a system where control rests more with drivers and riders, not a central platform. Kaspa's blockDAG structure offers transparency, and our open-source code allows community auditing.
*   **Direct & Efficient Payments:** By facilitating direct Kaspa payments between rider and driver, we aim to eliminate platform commissions. Kaspa's potential for fast transaction confirmations and low fees makes it ideal for near real-time settlement.
*   **Community-Driven Development:** We believe the platform should be built by and for its users. Open-source development encourages contribution and customization.
*   **Driver Empowerment:** Provide drivers with tools to manage their service independently, connect directly with riders, and potentially build their reputation on-chain in the future.

## Key Features (MVP - Currently Functional)

*   **User Authentication:** Secure login using Google Authentication (centralized for ease of onboarding in the MVP).
*   **Map Integration:** Uses OpenStreetMap for visualizing locations and potential routes.
*   **Ride Request:** Riders can specify pickup and drop-off points to simulate a ride request.
*   **Driver View:** Drivers can see simulated nearby ride requests and accept/reject them.
*   **Basic Real-Time Updates:** Riders and drivers see basic status changes for the simulated ride flow (using Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore).
*   **Direct Kaspa Payment Initiation:** Upon ride completion (simulated), the app generates a QR code with the driver's Kaspa address and the fare, enabling direct peer-to-peer payment outside the app. **(Note: Transaction confirmation is not yet integrated within the app).**
*   **Mobile-First Design:** Responsive layout for use on various devices.
*   **Customizable Brand:** Easily modify the logo and theme for individual driver branding.
*   **Firebase Backend (MVP):** Utilizes Firebase for authentication, real-time data synchronization (ride status), and hosting.

## Planned Enhancements & Future Features

*   **Automated Ride Matching:** Implement backend logic (likely via Firebase Cloud Functions) for efficient driver assignment.
*   **On-Chain Transaction Verification:** Integrate Kaspa node interaction (via backend) to confirm payments directly within the app.
*   **Driver Registration & Verification:** Develop a secure process for driver onboarding, potentially involving smart contracts in later phases.
*   **Reputation System:** Explore building an on-chain or decentralized reputation system for drivers and riders.
*   **In-App Communication:** Add chat functionality between rider and driver.
*   **Fare Calculation:** Implement more dynamic fare calculation based on distance, time, etc.
*   **Decentralized Identity:** Investigate decentralized identity solutions for user authentication.

## Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** React (with TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, Vite
*   **Mapping:** OpenStreetMap (likely via libraries like Leaflet or MapLibre GL JS)
*   **Backend (MVP):** Firebase (Authentication, Firestore/Realtime Database)
*   **Blockchain (Payment):** Kaspa (Direct peer-to-peer via QR code)
*   **Future Backend:** Firebase Cloud Functions, Kaspa Node Interaction

## How Kaspa is Used (MVP vs. Future)

1.  **MVP:** Kaspa is used for the **payment settlement layer**. The app facilitates the *initiation* of a direct peer-to-peer Kaspa payment by generating a QR code containing the driver's address and agreed fare. The actual transaction occurs outside the app using the users' wallets.
2.  **Future:** We plan to integrate Kaspa more deeply for:
    *   **Payment Verification:** Confirming transaction success on the blockchain via backend services.
    *   **Data Integrity:** Potentially storing ride hashes or reputation data on-chain.
    *   **Smart Contracts:** Exploring contracts for driver registration or dispute resolution.

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Node.js (v18 or higher)
    *   NPM or Yarn
    *   Firebase Account (for development/deployment)
    *   Kaspa Wallet (for testing payments)
    *   Firebase Studio or IDE
2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/KaspaTaxi.git
    cd KaspaTaxi/kaspaTaxi
    # Note: Ensure you are in the correct sub-directory
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Firebase Setup:**
    *   Create a Firebase project.
    *   Enable Firestore and Authentication (Google provider).
    *   Get your Firebase project configuration (apiKey, authDomain, etc.).
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `kaspaTaxi` directory (copy `.env.example` if provided) and add your Firebase config variables there.
    *   Example `.env` content:
        ```
        VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
        VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN
        VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
        VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET
        VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_SENDER_ID
        VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
        ```
    *   **Deploy Security Rules:** After configuring your rules in the `firestore.rules` file (initially set to deny all access), deploy them using the Firebase CLI. Make sure you have the CLI installed (`npm install -g firebase-tools`), are logged in (`firebase login`), and have initialized Firestore for your project (`firebase init firestore` if needed, select your project and point to `kaspaTaxi/firestore.rules`). Then run:
        ```bash
        # Make sure you are in the project's root directory (where firebase.json is, after running init)
        firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
        ```
5.  **Server Setup (for API Key Security):**
    * Navigate to the server directory: `cd server`
    * Install server dependencies: `npm install`
    * Create a `.env` file in the server directory with your API keys:
      ```
      PORT=3001
      MAPTILER_API_KEY=YOUR_MAPTILER_API_KEY
      ```
    * Return to the main directory: `cd ..`

6.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    # Run both the client and server
    npm run dev:all

    # Or run just the client (if you don't need the server features)
    npm run dev
    ```
7.  **IDX Configuration (If applicable):**
    *   Ensure necessary environment variables (like Firebase keys if not using `.env` for IDX) are configured in `.idx/dev.nix`.
    *   Rebuild the environment if needed within IDX.

## Customization

*   **Branding:** Replace `src/assets/taxi-icon.png`, modify colors in `tailwind.config.js`.
*   **Features:** Add/modify components in `src/components`. Adjust Firestore data structures as needed.

## Contribution Guidelines

*   Contributions welcome! Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
*   Open issues for bugs or feature requests.
*   Driver feedback is highly valuable!

## Roadmap Outline

*   **Phase 1 (Current MVP):** Core UI/UX, Firebase auth/data sync, manual Kaspa QR payment generation.
*   **Phase 2 (Near-term):** Backend logic via Cloud Functions (ride matching, basic state management), integrate on-chain Kaspa payment verification.
*   **Phase 3 (Long-term):** Explore on-chain driver registration, reputation systems, further decentralization.

## Security Considerations

*   **API Key Security:** We use a secure server-side approach to handle API keys. See [API_KEY_SECURITY.md](API_KEY_SECURITY.md) for details.
*   **Secure API Architecture:** Our architecture follows security best practices for protecting sensitive operations. See [SECURE_API_APPROACH.md](SECURE_API_APPROACH.md) for details.
*   **Map Access:** The map is only accessible to authenticated users. Both WebApp and DriverApp components require user login to display the map and related functionality.
*   **Environment Variables:** Use `.env` for local development. For production, move sensitive keys (like Firebase Admin SDK keys) to secure server-side environments (e.g., Cloud Functions environment variables), *not* client-side code. API keys like MapTiler are now handled by the Express server in the `server` directory, which provides a secure proxy for these services.
*   **Firebase Security Rules:** Implement robust Firestore rules to control data access based on authentication and user roles. **(Remember to deploy your rules using the Firebase CLI as described in the 'Getting Started' section).** See details below.
*   **Authentication:** We use Firebase Authentication with secure token verification on the server side.
*   **Kaspa Transaction Verification (Future):** Implement server-side verification to prevent spoofed payment confirmations.

### Firestore Security Rules Details

The `kaspaTaxi/firestore.rules` file provides a baseline set of security rules critical for protecting your Firestore data. It starts by denying all access and then explicitly allows operations based on user authentication and roles.

**Key Assumptions Made in the Provided Rules:**

*   **`users` Collection:** Stores user profiles keyed by Firebase Auth UID. Contains fields like `isDriver` (boolean) and potentially `kaspaAddress`.
*   **`rides` Collection:** Stores ride details, including `riderId` (UID of the requesting user) and `driverId` (UID of the accepting driver, initially null).
*   **Authentication:** Rules heavily rely on `request.auth` to check if a user is logged in (`request.auth != null`) and who they are (`request.auth.uid`).

**Summary of Provided Rules (`users` collection):**

*   **Read:** Users can read their own profile. Authenticated users can read profiles marked as `isDriver = true` (consider restricting which fields are publicly readable).
*   **Create:** Users can create their own profile document.
*   **Update:** Users can update their own profile. (Validation to prevent unauthorized changes like self-assigning `isDriver` status is recommended).
*   **Delete:** Disallowed from the client.

**Summary of Provided Rules (`rides` collection):**

*   **Read:** The rider or assigned driver can read a ride document. Any authenticated user can read rides with `status = 'pending'` (allowing drivers to see requests).
*   **Create:** Authenticated users can create rides for themselves (`riderId` must match their UID), setting initial status to `pending` and ensuring basic fields exist.
*   **Update:** Allows specific state transitions based on user roles (driver accepting, rider/driver cancelling, driver updating status). Further validation (e.g., checking `isDriver` status via `get()`) might be necessary.
*   **Delete:** Disallowed from the client.

**IMPORTANT:**

*   **Review & Customize:** These rules are a starting point. **You MUST review and adapt them** to match your exact Firestore data structure, field names (`riderId`, `driverId`, etc.), and application logic (status values, allowed transitions).
*   **Test Thoroughly:** Use the Firebase Emulator Suite or a test project to verify these rules prevent unauthorized access and allow legitimate operations.
*   **Other Collections:** Add rules for any other collections you use (e.g., `driverLocations`).
*   **Deployment:** Deploy the final rules using `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` as described in the Getting Started section.
