Fix TypeScript errors in server code

This commit addresses TypeScript type issues in the server code:

- Added proper type annotations to Express request and response objects
- Created interfaces for filter and orderBy parameters
- Fixed query type issues in Firestore operations
- Added proper typing for document snapshots
- Extended Request interface to include uid property

These changes ensure the server code compiles correctly with TypeScript's type checking, improving code quality and preventing potential runtime errors.
