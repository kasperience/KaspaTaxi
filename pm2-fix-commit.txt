Improve PM2 deployment reliability

This commit enhances the deployment script with better PM2 handling:

- Added cleanup of existing PM2 processes before deployment
- Implemented fallback to start server directly if ecosystem config fails
- Added error handling to prevent deployment failures
- Improved logging for better troubleshooting

These changes make the deployment process more robust and reliable,
especially when dealing with potential module system conflicts between
ES modules and CommonJS in the PM2 configuration.
