## Commercial Use and Customization

KaspaTaxi is an open-source project, freely available under the MIT license **for use with the Kaspa blockchain and KAS native coin only**. We believe in the power of community and open collaboration. However, we also recognize the unique needs of businesses and other blockchain projects seeking to leverage KaspaTaxi for commercial purposes.

If you are a corporate client looking to integrate KaspaTaxi into your taxi software or a blockchain project interested in extending KaspaTaxi to support custom currencies, including KRC-20 tokens or future stable coins on the Kaspa network, we are here to help.

We offer customization services to tailor KaspaTaxi to your specific requirements. Whether you need to adapt the platform to handle different payment methods, integrate with your existing systems, or create a branded user experience, our team is equipped to deliver a solution that meets your needs.
